# Project README

## Environment Setup

To configure the environment for this project, please refer to the `augan_environment.yml` file for detailed instructions on setting up the necessary dependencies and environment variables.

## Training Overview

This project is divided into two stages of training:

### 1. Parallel Training

In this stage, the network is trained in parallel for the left and right angles. You need to execute two separate Python scripts: `trainMAT_stage1.py` for training the networks for the left and right angles, and `trainMAT_stage2.py` for training the fusion network in the second stage.

#### Stage 1: `trainMAT_stage1.py`

For this stage, you will train separate networks for the left and right angles. Hereâ€™s how to modify the configuration:

1. **Path for Saving Weights:**
    - Set the `opt.name` parameter to either `'tribranch_stage1_R'` or `'tribranch_stage1_L'` depending on which angle you are training for (Right or Left).
    - The weights for the left and right networks will be saved separately. These will be saved under the `checkpoints` folder in directories named `'tribranch_stage1_R'` or `'tribranch_stage1_L'`.

2. **Loss File Path:**
    - Modify the `loss_file_path` to specify your own path. It's recommended to set a path for saving the training loss details.

3. **Target Modification:**
    - Inside the training loop, modify the target as follows:
      - For the left angle: `target5 = batch['left']`
      - For the right angle: `target5 = batch['right']`

#### Stage 2: `trainMAT_stage2.py`

While training the first stage network, the second stage fusion network can be trained simultaneously. This step is executed by running `trainMAT_stage2.py`. The trained model for this stage will be saved automatically under the `tribranch_stage2` folder in the `checkpoints` directory.

### 2. Serial Training

Once the networks in both the left and right angles are trained and stable in Stage 1 and Stage 2, you need to prepare for serial training:

1. **Move Trained Weights:**
    - Manually copy the trained weights from Stage 1 into a new folder called `tribranch_whole` inside the `checkpoints` folder.

2. **Start Serial Training:**
    - With the weights in place, you can proceed with serial training by running the training script for the entire network.

### Notes on Training and Epochs

- In our case, during the parallel stage, the training will be conducted for 50 epochs. Thus, when starting the serial training, we set it to begin from epoch 50 (opt.epoch = 50). If necessary, you can adjust the starting epoch by modifying the `opt.epoch` parameter in the configuration file.
